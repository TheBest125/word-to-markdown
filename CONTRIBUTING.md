# Contributing to Word to Markdown

## What should I do if my document doesn't convert correctly

1. Strip the Word Document down to isolate the troublesome part (e.g., remove the parts that are converting correctly)
2. Export the document as HTML
3. Drag and drop the export to [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/) and create a new Gist
4. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/benbalter/word-to-markdown/issues/new) describing the particular problem. Be sure to include a link to the Gist.

## Tips for reporting problems

* If a document isn't converting properly, isolate the troublesome section and create [a gist](https://gist.github.com) of the HTML export.
* Explain the expected output, actual output, and steps to reproduce
* Bonus points for screenshots of the expected and actual output
* Issues should be limited to one conversation error and describe it in detail. Issues that report "My document won't convert" or "I have these three problems" are less likely to be resolved quickly.
* Be sure to include what version of Microsoft Word was used to export the document
